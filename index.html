    <h2><u>About</u> </h2>
    <p>Driven by his experiences of traveling the world growing up, 19 year old indie pop artist David Garcia Marino aims to find himself in his music and grow as a person through it. Currently based in New Orleans, Louisiana, Garcia Marino started writing and recording short demos in his bedroom in the 8th grade. After years of experimenting writing and recording his own songs, Garcia Marino released his debut EP entitled "Sunshine Human" on October 5th 2019 after writing and recording the 5 songs on the EP in the space of a week. Garcia Marino has worked and co-written songs with the likes of Max Diaz, JW, QThaMusic, Messenger, Dami, Boy Rico, Sleepyhead, and hip-hop collective CARMONA. Currently he is attending university in New Orleans while he works on his debut project. </p>
